# Testing

Tests are broken into 2 categories:

_Production tests_ are tests that require production API keys to be loaded. They can be triggered with `npm run production-test`.

_Basic tests_ are tests that can be run anytime. They can be triggered with `npm run basic-test`.

You can run all tests using `npm run test`
